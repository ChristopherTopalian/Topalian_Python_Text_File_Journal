When we want to combine text files
into one main.txt file,
we place one of these scripts
in the folder of text files
that we want to combine
into one text file.

The original text files
are not changed by the process.

The process of combining files is easy.

The python script named Topalian_Combine_txt_Files.py
works both on a single folder of text files and multiple sub folders of text files.

The same is true for the script named Topalian_Combine_txt_Files.js.
This Node.js script works both on a single folder of text files and on multiple sub folders of text files.

We just place the script in the folder of
text files that we want to combine
and activate the script the correct way.

In the address bar of the text file folder
we type
cmd
press Enter

This opens our folder
in the Command Prompt.

To run the python script, we type:
python Topalian_Combine_txt_Files.py
press Enter

To run the Node.js script, we type:
node Topalian_Combine_txt_Files.js
press Enter

----

Alternatively, we can use Batch scripts
to combine text files.

But, we have to make sure
to use the correct batch script
depending on if it is a single folder
of text files, or multiple folders of text files.

If we have only ONE folder of text files
that we want to combine, then we use:

Topalian_Combine_txt_Files_One_Folder.bat
is used if we have
only one folder of text files
that we want to combine.

If we have MULTIPLE folders of text files
that we want to combine, then we use:

Topalian_Combine_txt_Files_All_Folders.bat 
is used if we have multiple folders
of text files that we want to combine.

We put the batch file in the folder of text
files and double click the batch file
to activate it.

It will combine the text files together
into one main.txt.

It will not change the original text files.
The original text files are kept the same.

----

Shown above, are only some of the ways
to combine text files.

Keep in mind that we can also use these
methods to combine other file types,
such as .js, .py, .html, and .md.

Happy Scripting :-)
